Script now contains -y that will deny cat, callnum or item keys from conversion.

This script is the engine for the discard process. There are several documents that give more detail
on the ILSWIKI, how ever there are two basic ways of running discard.pl.
1) Stand-alone - in which items are optionally converted in a card-centric fashion.
2) Optimized - in which a list of items are fed into discard.pl script; all are checked for basic 
   discardability, but if there are no bills, holds, serials, or on-order then they will be converted.

The machinery that creates the initial list is called the longcheckedout.pl script. I know, it's a 
bad name but it quickly pulls together a list of items that are 90 days old or older, and creates
a list that discard.pl can read. The two processes are segregated because longcheckedout.pl is used for other purposes.

Cron runs a shell script called discard.sh which creates the 90 day discard list and then feeds
it to discard.pl.
